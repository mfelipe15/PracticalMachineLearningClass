The band, currently on its 50th anniversary tour, packed Manhattan’s famed stadium on Wednesday night with thousands of fans eager to sing along to hits like “My Generation” and \"Won\\'t Get Fooled Again.\"\\xa0\\nThe show was even more celebratory because it was rescheduled from last fall, when Daltrey was diagnosed with viral meningitis. At the end of the show, he thanked the crowd for sticking around while he was \"really having a tough time with the reaper.\"\\n\"Here were are, still standing,\" he said with a grin.\\nSEE ALSO: Watch Lorde pay tribute to David Bowie (without an orange wig)\\n\\nRoger Daltrey at MSG on March 3.Image:  Theo Wargo/Getty Images)Joan Jett and the Blackhearts opened the show, warming up a crowd that was still filing in well into the set. Jett is still a well-oiled performer, hitting all the right notes and delivering classics like “I Love Rock ’n’ Roll” and “I Hate Myself for Loving You\" with her signature snarl.\\nBefore the Who took the stage, numerous messages were posted on the giant screen, including one dedicated to David Bowie, that read: \\n\"Tonight, we will distinctly miss David Bowie, longtime fan of the Who.\"\\n\"Tonight, we will distinctly miss David Bowie, longtime fan of the Who. He’s told the story of how he climbed the fence at London’s Roundhouse to sneak backstage and give Pete Townshend a copy of his new 1969 album, David Bowie. He covered \\'I Cant’ Explain\\' and \\'Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\\' on his Pinups album. Nearly every year at MSG, he sat in the first row right beside the stage. We’ll miss our friend, a true icon of music and art, and a brilliant innovator.”\\xa0\\n\\nlovely little tribute to David Bowie before the Who perform pic.twitter.com/2PEXOB5lv9\\n— black hermione (@YohanaDesta) March 4, 2016\\n\\nSoon after, the Who took the stage, launching right into performances of \"Who Are You,\" \"The Seeker\" and \"The Kids Are Alright.\"\\xa0\\nThen, Townshend grabbed the mic, telling an anecdote about how the band\\'s first show in the U.S. was in New York City, around 1967. However, the band wasn\\'t a hit straightaway.\\xa0\\n\"It took time for you f*ckin\\' Americans to catch up,\" he joked to uproarious laughter.\\xa0\\nAnd with that, the band went into \"I Can See for Miles\" and \"My Generation,\" the latter of which riled up the nostalgic, mostly older crowd. Speaking of nostalgia, lots of vintage footage and photographs served as the backdrop for different songs, amplifying the memory lane aspect of the tour.\\xa0\\n\\nthen & now pic.twitter.com/o3wp57V4aM\\n— black hermione (@YohanaDesta) March 4, 2016\\n\\nTownshend chatted with the crowd a bunch between songs, joking about how the Who weren\\'t always perceived as rock\\'n\\'roll.\\xa0\\n\"We were a boy band,\" he says. \"We had pop songs.\"\\nSo then he started playing \"Pictures of Lily,\" which he considers \"one of my favorite\" pop tracks.\\xa0\\nWhen it came to obvious fan favorites, songs like \"Behind Blue Eyes,\" \"Pinball Wizard\" and \"Teenage Wasteland\" ruled the night. However, the standout moments were the ones that allowed the band to flourish and flex some musical muscle.\\xa0\\n\\nPete Townshend of the Who performs at Madison Square Garden on March 3.Image:  Theo Wargo/Getty Images\"The Rock,\" an instrumental number that Daltrey called a favorite, was one such moment, an ever-expanding jam full of delicious guitar solos, coupled with an ever-changing array of backdrop footage, from photos of the Vietnam War, to newspaper headlines about John Lennon\\'s death, to footage of late drummer Keith Moon.\\xa0\\n\"Love, Reign O\\'er Me\" was also a masterful performance, opening with a keyboard solo and descending into an 8-minute rock journey, accented with Daltrey\\'s signature howls.\\xa0\\n\\nThey wrapped with (what else?) \"Baba O\\'Riley\" and \"Won\\'t Get Fooled Again.\"\\xa0\\nTownshend ended the night by introducing everyone in the band, dropping this funny little quip for drummer Zak Starkey.\\xa0\\n\"I hate all drummers, basically, but this one\\'s almost acceptable!\" he joked.\\xa0Starkey\\'s dad, Ringo Starr, would probably appreciate that.\\xa0\\nThen Daltrey took the mic so Townshend could get some applause for himself, then shared some choice parting words. \\xa0\\n\"Thanks for coming!\" Daltrey said. \"Be happy, be healthy ...

       " 'text': 'Today\\'s digital marketing experts must have a diverse skill set, including a sophisticated grasp of available media channels, the ability to identify up-and-coming opportunities, on top of having the basic skills of a brilliant marketer. What\\'s more, they have to possess a balance of critical and creative thinking skills in order to drive measurable success for their company.\\nThat\\'s why I asked 15 members of Young Entrepreneur Council (YEC) what they look for when hiring digital marketers. Their best answers are below.\\n1. Paid social media advertising expertise\\n\\nA new digital marketing hire should be well-versed in paid social media advertising, especially through Facebook or a similar social platform that our company uses regularly. They need to be able to understand and implement Facebook analytics and insights, create \"lookalike\" and custom audiences, experiment and test creative campaign and images, and be secure in their knowledge of the overall social media landscape. There are many budget-saving opportunities within the social media advertising space, so we want to make sure that our digital marketing talent knows the ins and outs of this popular and easy-to-implement marketing space. \\n— Miles Jennings, Recruiter.com\\nSEE ALSO: Web developers, data scientists, AI experts: The 15 top tech roles of 2016\\n\\n2. Sales skills\\n\\nWe\\'ve hired many digital marketers over the years, both outsourced and in-house. What we\\'ve found is that people who have sold successfully are much better marketers. They know how to engage with people and turn them into sales opportunities. While your digital marketers may not be closing deals directly, they need to know how to sell or they\\'ll be wasting your valuable marketing dollars without generating qualified lead opportunities for your sales team. \\n— Mark Cenicola, BannerView.com\\n3. Specific marketing channel expertise \\n\\nI see so many marketers who extol the virtues of every conceivable marketing channel: email, SEO, SEM, social, etc. And many channels might work for you, but the key to a successful marketing strategy is focusing on a few channels and using them really well. Often that means understanding the dynamics of that marketing channel deeply and leveraging those dynamics for your specific company. For example, in helping local businesses, Pinterest is less interesting (although it\\'s one of the best drivers of ecommerce traffic). I\\'d much rather focus on the intricate tactics of local SEO to get a client to No. 1 on Google, Maps and Yelp.\\n— Trevor Sumner, LocalVox\\n4. The ability to think objectively \\n\\nMarketers are usually one of the most passionate workers in the office. However, that passion can often cloud the judgment and measurement of marketing theories and initiatives. A marketer who can separate themselves from their work will navigate with an objective eye that can focus on what actually works — not just what they hoped would work.\\n— Wesley Mathews, High Level Marketing\\n5. The ability to execute and analyze drip marketing campaigns\\n\\nInbound marketing is a key skill in driving lead generation. While many marketers can come up with an initial innovative engagement strategy or CPC campaign, what intrigues me more is how they examine the incoming data and create a robust drip marketing campaign. Great automation on these campaigns is not about sending the same email to the entire flock that the campaign gathers. It\\'s about personal, well-written communication that varies depending on the actions performed seven emails deep into the campaign. That\\'s a lot of variation, and requires an analytical mindset and strategic thinking. Exceptional marketing happens when the art of communication expands upon the fundamental science of conversion. \\n— Eran Eyal, Springleap \\nSEE ALSO: 11 things your startup should look for in a creative hire for 2016\\n\\n6. A mix of creativity and analytical abilities\\n\\nDigital marketing requires both creative thinking and analytical thinking, so we look for a candidate capable of and excited about both. Many new candidates want to focus purely on one or the other, but it\\'s important to bring \"art and science\" to each digital program. Digital marketing allows us to be very measurable — even for beautiful creative campaigns — using analytics to inform future strategies. \\n— Kayla Wagner Faires, Revel Interactive\\n7. Good copy and visual storytelling abilities \\n\\nDigital media is a copy- and visual-driven medium unlike any other before it. Our social heart is won over (or double clicked on) by copy that is relevant and visuals that pull on our emotional strings. The native understanding and ability to manipulate those two elements is critical in today\\'s digital marketing landscape. \\n— Alex Frias, Track Marketing Group\\n8. A likable personality\\n\\nRelationship building is such a huge component of digital marketing, and a likable personality can go a long way. With so many people trying to connect with publishers, bloggers, journalists and influencers, someone with a great personality will always stand out and command attention. If you are being pitched by two similar people and one person is the equivalent to talking to a brick wall and the other person is outgoing and pleasant, who are you going to give your time to? The same applies to maintaining relationships — having a likable personality plays such a huge role, yet it\\'s often overlooked. \\n— Jonathan Long, Market Domination Media\\nSEE ALSO: 14 mobile marketing trends that will dominate in 2016\\n\\n9. An understanding of WordPress\\n\\nWith so many platforms now built on WordPress, it is a vital technical tool to add to your toolbox. If you want to create and manage a blog or even a website, WordPress has become the go-to platform for digital marketers. It also helps to continually educate yourself on new plug-ins and functionality because WordPress is always offering something new and useful that speeds up content production. \\n— Angela Ruth, Due.com \\n10. Self-promotion savvy \\n\\nIf you\\'re telling me that you have a strong understanding of social media and leveraging brands, then it should be very easy for you to do the same with your own. My interviewees are their own first project, and I use information I can find on them to make my final decision. Something should come up when I search their names, preferably on all the same platforms that I want to use for my clients. Messaging and vis-a-vis skills should be consistent across most platforms, and some obvious care should be put into the presentation and expansion of each one.\\n— Adam Steele, The Magistrate\\n11. Understanding of brevity\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t matter how good your product is if you can\\'t communicate your value proposition to potential customers in fewer than 140 characters. Digital marketers must be efficient and effective with minimal messaging. \\n— Nicholas Haase, Loot!\\n12. The ability to analyze quantifiable metrics\\n\\nNow, more than ever, being able to quantify the value of investing in marketing and advertising is vital. The battle for supremacy in the marketplace is not won in whole percentage points any longer. It\\'s about making the right choices and moving the needle slightly forward at every opportunity. Digital marketing consultants need to possess the competencies and the general knowledge required to provide actionable metrics, and prove their value with real data. Gone are the days of guessing whether or not a campaign was effective based on simple sales numbers. In-page tracking, coupled with analytics and metrics software are the tools of the day for marketers, and we expect any new consultants or team members to be able to leverage those tools to ensure accuracy and efficacy.\\n— Blair Thomas, EMerchantBroker\\nSee also: Top 11 digital advertising strategies you should use for mobile\\n13. Listening skills\\n\\nAs a digital marketer, our ability to promote our services through words, images, video and social media are essential. Digital marketing also provides an opportunity for its specialists to listen to various groups of people, from clients to consumers, in new ways. Through social media and analytical tools, we can listen to our consumers\\' thoughts on a product, relevant issue or our own services. When I hire a digital marketer, I\\'ll see if they\\'ve sought to listen to consumer and client needs and create a solution from their own observations or insights. \\n— Shalyn Dever, Chatter Buzz\\n14. Agility\\n\\nAt least once a month a new platform pushes its way into relevancy, or a major platform adjusts its algorithm. If you\\'re/they\\'re operating on a methodology devised without flexibility, and/or aren\\'t the type of person to be able to react appropriately, you and your business will fall behind the curve and lose ground fast. \\n— Mickey Meyer, JASH\\n15. Basic design skills\\n\\nBeing able to communicate a message properly is extremely important. However, digital marketing involves more than just words. A large part of digital marketing is about visual appearance. Anyone who calls themselves a digital marketer should have at least some basic knowledge of HTML, CSS or Photoshop. \\n— Dan Sapozhnikov, AdGate Media\\nScott GerberScott Gerber is a serial entrepreneur, author (Never Get a \\'Real\\' Job), TV commentator and founder of Young Entrepreneur Council (YEC), an invite-only organization comprised of the world\\'s most promising young entrepreneur...More\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nBusiness, career advice, cover letter, digital marketing, job hunt, Jobs, Marketing, Media, resume, Social Media, Work & Play, yec\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  if(window.pageChanged)\\n    window.omni({\"channel\":\"business\",\"content_type\":\"article\",\"v_buy\":null,\"v_buy_i\":null,\"h_pub\":502.0,\"h_buy\":null,\"h_pub_buy\":null,\"v_cur\":1.6,\"v_max\":1.6,\"v_cur_i\":1,\"v_max_i\":1,\"events\":\"event51,event61\",\"top_channel\":\"business\",\"content_source_type\":\"Internal\",\"content_source_name\":\"Internal\",\"author_name\":\"Scott Gerber\",\"age\":\"20\",\"pub_day\":8,\"pub_month\":3,\"pub_year\":2016,\"pub_date\":\"03/08/2016\",\"sourced_from\":\"Internal\",\"isPostView\":true,\"post_lead_type\":\"Default\",\"topics\":\"Business,career advice,cover letter,digital marketing,job hunt,Jobs,Marketing,Media,resume,Social Media,Uncategorized,Work &amp;

       " 'text': 'Analysis\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is a reason that\\xa0Donald Trump\\'s\\xa0outrageous statements and behavior feel familiar to many women.\\xa0\\nIt\\'s not because they know his declarative style and trademark shrug from reality television or political debates. Nor is it because his outsized role in American business made an unforgettable impression on them.\\nSEE ALSO: As Donald Trump targets women, Republicans say he could cost the party everything\\nThe eerie familiarity is more personal than that. They know Trump because they\\'ve encountered a man like him at home, work, on social media or in a relationship.\\xa0\\nThis man extols the virtues of women, but has no problem reducing them to sex objects. He casts himself as unflappable, but blames a woman when his weaknesses are revealed. He insists on personal responsibility, but denies, deflects and perhaps even turns violent when accused of wrongdoing.\\xa0\\n\\nThe media is so after me on women  Wow, this is a tough business. Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump!\\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 26, 2016\\n\\nThe psychological warfare of gaslighting, a subtle form of emotional abuse that puts the victim on the defensive, is his go-to strategy.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis is not how Trump sees himself or his actions, but it is arguably the image he projects to voters.\\xa0On Tuesday, when Florida police charged his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, with battery of a female reporter, Trump issued a series of tweets refuting the video evidence, discrediting the journalist and implying she could have been a dangerous or deadly threat.\\xa0\\n\\nWow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there!\\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2016\\n\\nPowerful women on the left and right forcefully criticized Trump\\'s reaction to the charges. \\n“Too often victims of violence and abuse stay silent, and Donald Trump’s remarks today demonstrate one of the reasons why,\" Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement. \"His actions today underscore that it is a fiction that he has been or would be supportive of any woman in this country.\"\\n\\nThis was the reporters statement- when she found out there was tape from my facility, she changed her tune. pic.twitter.com/N5815RS1At\\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2016\\n\\n\\nWhy is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference? What is in her hand?? pic.twitter.com/HQB8dl0fhn\\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2016\\n\\nOn Wednesday, a group of conservative female journalists and commentators called for Lewandowski\\'s firing.\\nTrump has a track record of making his female targets — and their defenders — seem like the foolish ones.\\n\\nNichole Bauer, assistant professor in the political science department at the University of Alabama, says the response was classic Trump. He\\'s practiced at denying previous statements even when\\xa0incontrovertible\\xa0evidence of them exists. While this isn\\'t exclusive to his commentary about women, Trump has a track record of making his female targets — and their defenders — seem like the foolish ones.\\xa0\\nOf course he wasn\\'t making a reference to menstruation when he joked about\\xa0Fox anchor Megyn Kelly having \"blood coming out of her wherever\" during a debate. And no, he most certainly did not use schlonged as a vulgar term when describing how badly Pres. Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary.\\xa0\\n\\nThe press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women, when they know that it is just the opposite!\\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 26, 2016\\n\\n\"There’s definitely an accepted belief among the Republican and Democratic mainstream that this sort of outmoded sexism that Donald Trump demonstrates has no real place in discourse,\" says Bauer.\\xa0\\nYet, instead of apologizing, or acknowledging how the woman in question — or any woman, for that matter — might find his remarks offensive, Trump doubled down and obfuscated reality.\\xa0\\nMany women have been here before, whether it\\'s with a coworker who denies the meaning of a sexist comment or a partner who is quick to end an argument by using the word emotional.\\xa0\\n...he\\'s telling women that they don\\'t deserve the same respect and agency as men.\\nTrump\\'s denials may make him appear unassailable to some, but to women they send an entirely different message, says Bauer. By denying the nature of his commentary and behavior, he\\'s telling women that they don\\'t deserve the same respect and agency as men.\\xa0\\nWhile Republican women tend to support traditional roles, Bauer says, they do so believing that deference to a male authority figure or husband is their choice. Trump\\'s faultless behavior effectively takes that autonomy away from them by creating a political climate in which the woman is always wrong.\\xa0\\nThis may\\xa0explain why he performed so poorly with Republican women in one recent survey. That\\xa0NBC/WSJ poll found that 47% of female Republican primary voters cannot see themselves voting for Trump. His favorability ratings were higher, at 59%, amongst registered Republican women in a\\xa0CNN/ORC poll, though it did not ask whether they intended to vote for him.\\n\\n\"@Don_Vito_08: \"A picture is worth a thousand words\" @realDonaldTrump #LyingTed #NeverCruz @MELANIATRUMP pic.twitter.com/5bvVEwMVF8\"\\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 24, 2016\\n\\nThese polls also don\\'t fully reflect his\\xa0recent, unseemly attacks on Heidi Cruz, wife of his opponent Sen. Ted Cruz, or his statement on Wednesday that if abortion is banned, women who have one illegally should \"face some sort of punishment.\"\\xa0\\nThough Trump immediately clarified that comment as a response to a hypothetical question and then reversed his position, it\\'s clear that he\\'s not only willing to publicly embarrass and degrade women, but also consider\\xa0depriving them of physical\\xa0freedom.\\xa0\\nSuch power dynamics aren\\'t hypothetical to women in abusive workplaces or relationships, who cannot fathom a political reality that mirrors their private hell.\\xa0\\n\"People are doing it as a strategy to control others and elevate themselves and insulate themselves from attack.\"\\nJackie White, emerita professor of psychology and a senior research scientist at the Center for Women’s Health and Wellness at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, says an approach that victimizes women and then blames them for playing a part in their degradation is about manipulation.\\xa0\\n\"People are doing it as a strategy to control others and elevate themselves and insulate themselves from attack,\" she says. \"They’re going to present themselves as a very self-assured, knowledgable person.\"\\xa0\\nMeanwhile, such behavior silences the victim. She may feel depressed, passive or paralyzed. Feelings of doubt and insecurity set in. Women know this experience well, says White.\\xa0\\nShe worries, however, that the tactics on display in the\\xa0campaign could send just as powerful a message to men as to women.\\xa0\\nTrump\\'s behavior may consciously or\\xa0subconsciously\\xa0lead some men to\\xa0endorse harmful stereotypes and engage in emotional manipulation, particularly if they feel threatened by social and demographic change and evolving gender roles.\\n\"[Trump\\'s] actions could inspire them to feel justified in clinging to what they see as their deserved elevated status,\" White says.\\xa0\\nThat\\'s what makes Donald Trump so dangerous. Even if he\\'s offering the public a performance, the fallout is unconscionable for both women and men.\\xa0\\n',\n",
